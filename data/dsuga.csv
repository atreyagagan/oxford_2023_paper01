Because Pastor was not educated, foreign donations were mismanaged, a pastors was a liar, etc. There was physically fighting in the course of removing the pastor, so the youth took over the church and another pastor was appointed who worked for two years. Another group within the church removed him due to allegations of embezzlement of church funds. The group that removed the pastor had their interests and now the mother-in-law is of women leader or treasurer, the wife is the choir leader/children's groups, brother-in-law is the youth leader. Having seen that, I resigned and got a second thought about the church. The impact in my life is that what happens in church is not for spiritual purposes. This made me change my religion back to the Catholic Church.",2,4,-2,167,-0.0119760479041916

All my life I have been an orphan so I worked so hard to get families with people so as to be converted. Because of being an orphan, I always had no one to turn to so when clocked the age of 22 years, I saw it wife to marry. Ever since I got married, my life began having meaningful turnover. I automatically began to gain respect from people and not pity. Everyone begin looking at me as a responsible man and a true man. Seeing that I had gained weight among the people, and especially having become a father as well, I came.Out to campaign for a position of being a general secretary. Little did I know that.Once was on my side. Everyone was talking good about me and about myself or my and my family at large. I want my opponents by a very large number of votes. I am sure that it is because I succeeded in marrying a Good Wife that I am able to be a great man that I am currently because before I got married I had tried but was all in vain.

But glory be to God. We got married when we were still young, but he managed to make such a wonderful introduction and give presents to my parents. Things function fetch so many people from various places witnessed it come to an end. It is from this that one can rightly say that the functions served quite a number of people's interests.",6,0,6,157,0.0382165605095541

One month after I gave birth, I really suffered to care for all three children, school fees including so I begin digging for people so as to get what to eat. I didn't even have clothes to wear, and for my children it was.With that, went on for about 10 years. Later on, my husband returned. He had a lot of weight. He was very fat. And me, I was so miserable, including the children. He returned at night. I'm home. Someone came to pick him, noting that they had forgotten a bag of money at the police station. I cried. Life was so hard, so hard and us. And at the moment when I had seen hope again, it disappeared. Anyway, later on he sent someone to give us some help, but it was so little, so I went to Nagongera cried for a pastor and he put for us some small structure a grass thatched house. However.They have eventually collapsed as thieves knocked it down. So I ended up going back to Nagongera and stayed with Pastor. He rented for us a room there. Shortly I heard news that my husband had died. And guess what he ciscumed to HIV/AIDS on 29/12/1992. I honestly mourned, but truly in my heart I was thankful to the Lord. This is because that night when he returned, if he spent a night at home, I am sure I would have had intercourse with him and I would also be infected.

I left there my forms and come back home. After three days I got a call saying they have put their money in the account and that was about five years after his death.I was able to put up this structure, this beautiful house and also complete the children's fees payment.They all managed to enroll for colleges.
