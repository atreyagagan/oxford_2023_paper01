Religious leaders encouraged for the issue to be discussed in Friday seminars and other Muslim gatherings to so that Muslims formed the majority and that their voices should be heard and represented.

This is because its members may easily choose to embrace a new religion since a secular state entoils it.

A new government came into place and find it necessary to provide a new constitution as the 1997 constitution does not have enough promising and is not very detail to address. Some of the common issues in a democracy is the 21st century. Such as presidential term limit, freedom as association, sexual identity in a global context. Balancing between the interest of the majority and minority, for example ethnicity, religion. The most common problem is we have leaders (religious leaders) did not understand some of the constitutional uses totally. They were letting people think about secular state that to me are not very accurate practically speaking. For example, we have some religion leaders telling secular state means religion is totally reserve from state affairs. Example, issue of homosexual in the Gambia.

Our palm tree were tapped by not only by the Christian in Sifoe but also foreigners. We patially depend on palm tree for our survivals thus we saw this as a threat to our livinghood. I, together with my Muslim brothers stood up to put an end to this menace. One day, we convened a meeting in order to randalized all the palm trees they had tapped.

In 2016 if I could recall well, some members of my party including Solo Sandang staged a peaceful demonstration demanding for electoral reforms. Unfortunately the police interrupted the demonstration and arrested some prominent members of the group including Solo Sandang who was tortured to death. Solo’s death sparked another demonstration lead by Ousaino Darboe and the some executive members of UDP demanding for Solos Sandang ‘dead or alive’. This lead to their arrest and subsequent incarceration. This event had handicapped the party by learning only their (executive) deputies behind. As a result when election was near UDP and other political parties decided to go into a coalition and contest against Jammeh in 2016 presidential election. The coalition eventually won. Ousaino Darboe and other jailed for some months and this resulted to the death of some others after their imprisonment. For the fact that these people who lost their lives sacrificed for a free and dignified Gambia but could not witnessed the fruit of their labour is what saddened me most. The  imprisonment of Darboe and group without doubt eventually lead to the disintegration of our party in which some feollow Barrow and other follow Darboe. What is more annoying is the fact that president Barrow embraced members of APRC who did not vote for him in 2016 and UDP turns to be his a better enemy.
